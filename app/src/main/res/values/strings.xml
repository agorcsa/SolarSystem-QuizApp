    <string name="scroll_text1">The Solar System application is an astronomy quizz designed for everyone. It contains a number of 10 questions. The questions are mainly general curiosities ot fun facts about our Solar System. </string>
    <string name="scroll_text2">For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Agesâ€“Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth.</string>
    <string name="scroll_text3" formatted="false">The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system\'s known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun\'s four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System\'s total mass.</string>
